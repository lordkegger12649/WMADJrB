			<h3 id="who">Who Am I?</h3>

			<p>
				I'm the captain of the starship <i>Enterprise</i>.
				I have a lot of hair on my head (unlike some other 
				<em>Star Fleet</em> captains I could name). I'm a swash-buckler and a 
				cowboy diplomat. I'm a fighter 
				<b>AND</b> a lover. Hire <strong>ME</strong> for your next mission. 
			 </p>

			<h3 id="acc">My Accomplishments</h3>
				<p>
				I have many accomplishments, but I am quite shy and don't like to brag
				or make a spectacle of myself (lol)
				</p>

				</li>
			</ul>
